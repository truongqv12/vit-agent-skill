# Test Report Format

Structured QA report template. Sacrifice grammar for concision. The report MUST
end with a single machine-readable overall verdict line so a calling workflow
can gate on it.

## Template

```markdown
# Test Report — {date} — {scope}

## Test Results Overview
- **Total**: X tests
- **Passed**: X | **Failed**: X | **Skipped**: X
- **Duration**: Xs

## Coverage Metrics
| Metric   | Value | Threshold | Status |
|----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Lines    | X%    | 80%       | PASS/FAIL |
| Branches | X%    | 70%       | PASS/FAIL |
| Functions| X%    | 80%       | PASS/FAIL |

## Failed Tests
### `test/path/file.test.ts` — TestName
- **Error**: Error message
- **Stack**: Relevant stack trace (truncated)
- **Cause**: Brief root cause analysis
- **Fix**: Suggested resolution

## UI Test Results (if applicable)
- **Pages tested**: X
- **Screenshots**: ./screenshots/
- **Console errors**: none | [list]
- **Responsive**: checked at [viewports] | skipped
- **Performance**: LCP Xs, FID Xms, CLS X

## Build Status
- **Build**: PASS/FAIL
- **Warnings**: none | [list]
- **Dependencies**: all resolved | [issues]

## Critical Issues
1. [Blocking issue description + impact]

## Recommendations
1. [Actionable improvement with priority]

## Unresolved Questions
- [Any open questions, if any]

## Verdict
Overall: PASS | FAIL
```

## Machine-readable verdict

- The final line is `Overall: PASS` or `Overall: FAIL` — one token a caller can
  parse to gate delivery.
- `Overall: FAIL` whenever any test failed, the build failed, or the project's
  test runner could not be determined (honest unknown-runner failure).
- `Overall: PASS` only when the real suite ran and genuinely passed. Never emit
  `PASS` by skipping, disabling, or weakening tests (see Anti-cheat in SKILL.md).
- A caller that enforces 100% pass requires `Overall: PASS` with zero failures.

## Guidelines

- Include ALL failed tests with error messages — don't summarize away details.
- Coverage: highlight specific uncovered files/functions, not just percentages.
- Screenshots: embed paths directly in the report for easy access.
- Recommendations: prioritize by impact (critical > high > medium > low).
- Keep the report under 200 lines — split into sections if a larger scope needs
  it.
- Save the report by the project's existing naming/location convention, or via
  an output-organization capability when one is available.
